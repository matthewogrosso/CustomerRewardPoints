# Customer Reward Points in React

## How to run on Codepen.io

This project depends on React. To get it to run on codepen.io put the HTML code from CustomerRewardPoints.html in the HTML portion of a Pen, then put the CSS and JS from the CustomerRewardPoints.css and CustomerRewardPoints.js files in the CSS and JS portions of the pen.

### Settings for the Pen

Under Settings > JS select Babel as the JavaScript preprocessor.

Put the following two links under external scripts:

1. https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js
2. https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js
